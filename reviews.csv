"The latest version of the app is the worse. The discount codes disappear shortly after you register them or don't work at all even though they are still valid (I tested them in my friend's phone who still had the old version and they worked just fine). My saved addresses also disappeared, as well as my old rides. The customer service should be easily reached through the app, like in the Uber app, but instead you have to send an email to the company (and probably never hear back or don't have you problem solved/a refund).",5,1
How do you get in touch with Customer Support for passengers?  I have an issue with my payment options and contacting a CSR is impossible.,5,1
"I had a terrible experience with this app. I used it in Rio to go to Botafogo from Leblon (that’s a 15 minutes ride without traffic) and the driver managed to get us in Rio Comprido. 

The driver was completely lost and didn’t know how to follow the GPS. 

Rio de Janeiro is a very dangerous city and this happened night time. I felt totally unsafe passing through very dangerous neighborhoods for almost an hour. 

When I made a complaint at the app, I got absolutely zero support or solution. They simply gave me back the money that had exceeded from the predicted fee. Needless to say I immediately deleted the app afterward.

******************************************

Eu tive uma péssima experiência com o aplicativo quando utilizei aqui no Rio, para ir do Leblon para Botafogo (uma viagem de aproximadamente 15 minutos sem trânsito) e o motorista conseguiu nos levar até Rio Comprido.

O motorista estava completamente perdido e não sabia seguir o GPS.

Rio de Janeiro é uma cidade muito perigosa e isso aconteceu de noite. Eu me senti completamente insegura passando por bairros perigosos por quase uma hora.

Quando fiz uma reclamação no aplicativo, não recebi nenhum apoio ou solução. Simplesmente estornaram o dinheiro que excedia a taxa/preço previsto para a viagem. Não preciso nem falar que apaguei o aplicativo imediatamente depois.",1,0
"Someone made an account on this app using my email address. I get all of their receipts, trip info, and customer service responses. And it’s not me. They don’t even have remotely the same name as me

I have emailed them several times to ask them to stop emailing me. They had me describe myself to prove it’s incorrect, and they’re still emailing me. They should at least have some sort of email verification to prove their emailing a valid email address. 

I downloaded this app just to give it a negative review. Maybe someone will finally listen and delete my email address because this is pathetic.",1,0
"The prices on 99 are always better than Uber. As far as using the app is concerned, it's been a decent experience. Cars arrive quickly and the app works as expected. There are a few issues that keep me from using it though. 

1. I don't have a Brazilian debit card and my foreign credit card doesn't work, even though I successfully added it as a payment option. I can only pay with cash, which leads me to #2...
2. The cash option quotes a price that is never accurate. It is just an estimate and the driver turns on the meter which always ends up higher than you expect. Very very misleading.
3. You can't split rides with friends like in Uber. This seems like a basic function that should be there.

If these things were addressed I would use this exclusively.",2,0
"Tired of drivers that simply cancel the rides after accepting it, sometimes several minutes after doing so. There should be some kind of punishment to them. Also getting rid of the annoying notification on app start would be a good idea",3,1
I had an issue about a ride in which the driver was 6 minutes away but kept accepting rides from other apps. I waited for almost 20 minutes when I had to cancel. Requested another ride and the driver didn’t move for five minutes. When I canceled they wanted to charge me. I made a complaint and they ask me to take screenshots for details about an issue that they have records on. Ridiculous,1,0
"I watched my girlfriend pay with pix, and the driver told us everything was fine and then when we exited the taxi a short while later, we were issued with a message that the trip we had just paid for with pix was told by the driver was unpaid for this is completely unacceptable. As we both sat there and watched the pix transaction be confirmed by the driver, and then say it was OK for us to exit his car.",1,0
"I don’t get it. You get millions in investment from Japanese and Chinese groups and your first real update is so bad. All my rides were lost, my favorite addresses disappeared and you no longer see which category cars are near you. This is a poor scheme to make us login, as if there were many cars around but in fact if you select top there will be little and some times none near you.",1,0
"I tried 99 as an alternative to Uber.
But to my overall disappointment, several rides I had to cancel after I noticed 99 drivers never moved after I requested their service.
And one of the few rides I manage to find a driver, he explained that he was waiting for me to cancel my request - that’s why it took so long for him to pick me up.
I do not recommend this device even to the ones I’m not fond of.

(Eu tenteio 99 como uma alternativa ao Uber.
Mas para meu desapontamento geral, várias corridas eu cancelei depois que notei que o motorista não movia o carro para me pegar após aceitar a corrida.
E numa das poucas vezes que consegui uma corrida, o motorista me explicou que a demora dele foi porque ele estava esperando que eu cancelasse a corrida.
Não recomento este serviço nem para aqueles que não são meus afetos.)",1,0
"Time and price estimates are always much less than they turn out to be. Drivers are rude and very hard to communicate with should you need to call them. Lots of taxis cancel on me. Just not a good nor consistent experience, particularly with their fake branding all about love - I don't see that from the drivers at all. Cabify is far better on that note.",2,0
"I’ve spent more than an hour taking to their specialties, and they couldn’t fix the problem. Saying that my bank declined the trans arils - but it’s not true. I checked with my banks and with Visa and they don’t see any transaction attempts. Really frustrating. Can’t use the app and the team isn’t competent enough to provide help",1,0
"I loved 99, it was reliable and convenient. The new version is much worse in locating a taxi, cancelling ( e.g. when the search takes too long) does not work. The new process for payments - although it seems to better avoid the problem of drivers not ending the ride - is awkward and sometimes takes a long time. I am going back to hailing taxis “by hand”.",1,0
"1. Literally even second after requesting a ride they want to charge you a fee, even if the driver is 15 minutes away while your ride is 10 minutes long.
2. They want your biometric data if you want more than one ride a day.
3. You cannot delete your account if you had a ride in the past 15 year.",1,0
Its been a week that only apple pay and cash is working. I cant order with debit or credit card. I thought it was my phone issue but i checked in a friend’s phone and it was the same issue. Please fix it.,3,1
"Just like uber, in this new update, you have to insert your destination before a trip! It feels like a prison. You can’t get a taxi without knowing for sure where you are going! What if you want to go on a sightseeing trip around the city? What if you want to go to a sushi place and your girlfriend wants to eat italian and you drive by a frech restaurant and want to stop? Terrible update! Will never use the app again!!!",1,0
"The app keeps sending cashback and promotional notifications late at night, constantly waking me up, and there’s no way to disable them without disabling every single notification. Also, there’s no way to contact support and complain about that through the app, only an automated and unhelpful bot.",1,0
"99 ia usually cheaper than other similar apps, but I’ve been having problems lately. Every time I need a car, the driver accepts the race and goes to the opposite way, which makes me cancel the trip (because I usually have an appointment and don’t want to be late) and use another app to get a car. If I keep having this kind of problems, I’ll uninstall the app.",1,0
If you can use Uber eats. This app has been late delivering many meals. The food is cold by the time I get it. When I try to cancel they charge me anyways and the food would have been twenty or more minutes late. Sad because they have more options but Uber eats is much more reliable.,1,0
"Any other app, I would just disable notifications entirely, but I need to know when my vehicle arrives to pick me up. 

99 doesn’t let me disable their insanely annoying notifications that come about 2x an hour throughout the day nagging me to order food from them. 

A real product manager would never allow this to happen, and yet, here we are. 

99 - please let me turn off your marketing notifications. This is an abuse of your notifications privileges.",1,0
"I’ve been enjoying so much to use 99 taxi!
It’s easy, fast and cheaper than Uber. 
Uber never more!",5,1
"I used the app a lot although it is by far the worst among its competitors. It is slower the the others, waiting time is the highest and there arr lots of bugs.
Recently I needed to talk to the support for the first time and the service was terrible. The experience was way better when I needed it with the other apps.
I will not use it anymore.",1,0
"Best cars and excellent drivers so far. Bravo. 

Keep it up",5,1
"Used to use the app every day, more than once. But after this last update the “debit” payment option has been removed. I am left with no other option than to move to its competitor, Easy Taxi (same discounts, but with debit option available). Bad bad move from 99. Lost a client, and suspect sill loose more.",1,0
"- Can't change address during a ride
- App keeps suggesting wrong addresses even though Im at a frequent address
- route estimation and driver wait times are always erratic and inaccurate (sometimes the driver disappears from the map and we are left wondering....is he coming?)
Crashes and hangs a LOT...",1,0
"What have the done! This used to be such a simple, easy-to-use app. They have now tried to replicate the Uber interface, inserted more steps, and made it overly complex. You have to now pinpoint your exact location on the map and the addresses it generates are wrong. Bring back the old interface please!!!!",1,0
Cars cancel with no repercussion. Prices listed when booking are usually 30-40% lower than actual price paid (you pay way more than what’s quoted). Often searches for several minutes then finally responds saying no cars are available. Uber and Cabify are way better.,1,0
"In a failed attempt to automate their support system, they many times send automatic replies that don't solve the complaint. Because the rides are very often mischarged, I would not recommend the app, because it’ll be a hassle trying to get your money back. Uber is better",1,0
Your security is pathetic. You allow users to use whatever email they chose without any authentication. Someone in Brazil is using my email and I can’t stop this. I have tried calling your company with no success. Your company is pathetic,1,0
"When I want to call a ride for someone else the app insisted in using my location. This is wrong. Also add a swap button for the pick and destination.

Stop changing my pickup address.",1,0
"I’ve been trying to set up this app for the past few days. Every time I request the verification number, it never gets sent. I have a USA number that starts with +1. Hope they fix this very soon.",1,0
"I have the newest iPhone, I open the app but it locks on the getting started screen, I cannot tap the Next icon. Nothing happens, this causes the app to be useless.",1,0
"I paid double my ride estimate by the app.
The app was offering me a voucher and then said it was not applicable.
Totally incorrect selling something you are not offering and having the client paying for it! Use Cabify or Uber, never 99.",1,0
"The drivers consistently cancels the rides, leaving the user unnatended. There is no feature whatsoever to reduce this and I endedep up losing hours waiting for drivers who had no regard for the user.",1,0
"This was a great app, but is now useless for Americans traveling in Brazil. The option to pay inside the app does not work with PayPal or American credit cards.",1,0
"This app literally steals money. 

• During a trip the price of a trip can go up. As a passenger you can’t report it or do anything about it. The UX is non-existent. App: “It happens.” 

• Drivers often lack change and give “credit” on cash payments only for the app to not let you use those credits. 

Worst car share app ever.",1,0
"In new version, when your driver accepts your ride, the app makes an annoying and embarrassing ""felling down cash"".
You can not disable!",1,0
Be careful. Support is not good. Have tried to get refunded for a ride I never took—the app showed I was “on my way” but I was never picked up. I contacted the driver and no response. They stole R$50. This should NEVER happen!!!,1,0
They don’t accept foreign credit cards and also want to do all kinds of weird facial recognition,1,0
"Someone created an account with my email, I can’t even cancel it, I have tried through the app and the “help” tab is empty",1,0
Simple the best!,5,1
"Worst app and worst annoying repetitive intrusive ads. 
Propaganda is everywhere and sadly the service is unforgivingly bad.",1,0
Latest version Ruined the app!! Not using it until they fix it!!!,1,0
99 - SPAMers - they use their customer base to spam messages from 99 food and don’t give the option to unsubscribe from these messages! 😡,1,0
The new app couldn’t be worst! 99Taxi become a bad joke after the merge with Chinese holding.,1,0
Waiting times are always mistaken,3,1
"It was by fara the best app, now the UX has gone sour, constant crashes and bad customer service",2,0
would you like to free the paste copy option ?,1,0
"Rides canceled 6 times. I had to walk.
Cancelaram 6 vezes a mesma corrida. Tivemos que andar.",1,0
"🇺🇸They sent me a discount for a ride I canceled because the driver accepted my ride while still driving another passenger for another app, I tried using the discount on another ride but instead of having the discount applied I was charged for the full amount of the ride plus a cancellation fee for that ride I just mentioned.
I sent a message to the company they replied with a coupon for the next ride which I’ve tried to use in the next 6 or 7 rises but never worked! I have all the prints! The estimated amounts before finding a driver, the drivers and the total after every single ride ended which never had any discounts.
For this reason I am giving this app a ONE STAR because I can’t rate it any lower. 
I wanted to post all the prints as proof for my frustration, but whatever!
There’s plenty of good transportation apps out there!
Hasta la vista 99!!
—————————-
🇧🇷Eles me enviaram um desconto para uma viagem cancelada porque o motorista aceitou minha viagem enquanto ainda dirigia outro passageiro por outro aplicativo. Tentei usar o desconto em outra viagem, mas, em vez de aplicarem o desconto, fui cobrado pelo valor total da viagem  mais uma taxa de cancelamento por aquela corrida que acabei de mencionar.
 Enviei uma mensagem à empresa e eles responderam com um cupom para a próxima corrida que tentei usar nas próximas 6 ou 7 corridas, mas nunca funcionou!  Eu tenho todos os prints!  Os valores estimados antes de encontrar um motorista, os motoristas que aceitaram e o total após cada corrida terminada, que nunca tiveram descontos.
 Por esse motivo, estou atribuindo a este aplicativo UMA ESTRELA, porque não posso classificá-lo mais baixo.
 Queria postar todos os prints como prova da minha frustração, mas pra mim agora tanto faz!
 Existem muitos aplicativos de transporte bons por aí!
 Hasta la vista 99 !!",5,1

"For an Expat living in São Paulo, there are few apps that I would say that I use daily.  99 taxi is an app that I can say that I utilize every day.  It makes life much easier.  There is a reliability and convenience that comes from this app and the cabs that subscribe to the service.  In the last 2 years, having used it everyday, I have had one single problem with one driver claiming to have picked me up and cancelling the ride and it only cost me a little bit of frustration that day (it was raining that day, so very congested traffic).  Commuting in São Paulo can be very frustrating, but this app give the non-native a fantastic chance to safely get around this magnificent city for work or exploration.  Without this app, it would actually force me to walk to one of the nearest taxi stands to see if there is a cab available, and it turns in to a bit of an Easter egg hunt for a taxi.  That lack of reliability causes stress, as I'm always worried about being on time or early.  A thank you goes to the developers and the business machine that allow me an easy way to get to work everyday!",5,1
"This app is perfect for calling and paying for, reliable taxi cab service. I receive much of the similar information that competing ride-share service apps provide (name/photo of driver, car description/lic. No, live tracking of vehicle, etc.) and I can also choose any mode of payment, allowing me to travel without having cash. I even receive an invoice immediately leaving any taxi, with the total cost, ride information, and even a map of my fare from start to finish. The service allows me to rate drivers, contact drivers (for lots items, for instance), and is very responsive if an issue is reported. The staff administering the app are extremely professional, and any issue or concern has an immediately response.  I use this app quite frequently, and I would strongly recommend this app to anyone where 99Taxi provides service.",5,1
"I love 99taxis app,  but is it possible to put more conversation options? I understand you might not want to put a write-your-own-message tool for several reasons, but at least create more options perhaps? Just things that happen sometimes and I can't alert the driver without calling or making him call which I can't do because I never have cellphone credits and don't want to spend his. Please consider it nonetheless. It would be great for me and many people I know. All my friends promptly agreed with me when I said this, and I think many other people would as well. 
Thank you for the app anyways, it always gets me out of a pickle when I need it!",5,1
"Visited São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, and downloaded 99Taxi for our trip. The app was very easy to use and had more options than uber or lyft, like being able to choose payment options and all the built in discounts like first ride free! Also, I forgot my phone in the taxi, and the driver brought it back because 99Taxi customer service was able to contact him right away. Such a lifesaver!!",5,1
"Very useful, works well, but here are a few suggestions.  *GPS locating is way off when not signed in to a wifi location.  Frequently need to set location manually.  Sometimes it is off by a couple of blocks.
*need to be able to store favorite locations.  If there is one, I haven't figured it out.

Keep up the good work, but try to get these improvements done!",4,1
"My first ride should be free, but the driver asked me for a password, them charged me using my credit card because he told this app wasn't working. After that the app tried to double charge me, I cancelled but my free ride was gone anyway. Smartass driver poor software support.

Many times it shows no drivers available. And others the driver go away after accepting the ride.

It doesn't work very well in Florianopolis. I miss Uber or Lyft here, they're so much better.",2,0
"I've been using this app for a couple of months and find it very good. Actually I increased the number of taxi rides due to its convenience and simplicity to use, and also because I am always sure I'll have a taxi at the door with it.",5,1
"I love this app! No more waiting on the streets trying to wave down a taxi or calling for one on a phone and waiting for 15 to 30 mins for it to arrive.  My taxi arrives within 2-10 mins depending on the time of day and the location that I'm at.  Best of all, I don't need to carry cash ... It deducts the fare direct from my credit card.  The taxis are always clean and comfortable!",4,1
"So this was my favorite app !! It was amazing. 
However with the new update, my street name has changed, (half of it it has been replaced with another name, and the part that is correct is spelled wrong). When I try to add the address manually it tells me that it's invalid... I'm so unhappy. Also the position of the address on the map is incorrect.
I like the new design, but I can't use this app with the wrong street name.
Previous edition was so much better :(",2,0
Very helpful app! Really recommend. Very easy and quick to handle. Don't take so long waiting for a taxi anymore. Also this app helps a lot the taxi driver that don't need to take so long driving a empty car. Good and helpful for both sides! Thumbs up!,5,1
I love this app. But it's really bad for the driver to get in your destination. Not sure if the map has issues on the driver's side but VERY often it happens that the driver is super close to you and all of sudden they go very far and takes a long time to get where you are. I really dislike that and doesn't happen much with other apps.,3,1
"Very good app, I've tried EasyTaxi and Taxija and 99 is the better. No problems paying with paypal or calling the cabs. I only wonder if they could include the possibility to choose premium cars that offers more comfort, even if we could pay more.",5,1
Still some bug issues and user interface to be fixed.  Needs to be more accurate when finding my location,5,1
"Using 99 is very easy. In less than a minute you can ger a cab and you can choose how you will pay; money, credit and debit cards. And the security of knowing the name and picture of the driver, telephone numer and license plate of the vehicle",5,1
"I'm wowed by this app. It's great, reliable, fast, and it saves me the headache of finding/calling a taxi driver.(especially because I don't live in Brazil) 
I'm not sure if they have this app somewhere else but from now on I will be using it sporadically.",5,1
"Got stranded without cash and requested a taxi that allows credit card payment. To my surprise, I got just what I needed in under 3 minutes and my day was saved.",5,1
The app works. You order a cab or a private car and with some luck you don't end up on a biggot's car. The problem for me is the insane amount of notifications about promotions that the app bombards my phone with. Made me consider deleting the app several times.,3,1
"Great application to find cabs in São Paulo.
However new maps have issues with address. Number is often positioned at the wrong location on a street. It used to be better in the previous version.",4,1
"Worked perfectly so far. Think it will be even better when they incorporate payments. Haven't tried in rush hour or when demand is crazy yet. But so far, amazing.",5,1
"Works like a charm, taxi arrives within max of few minutes. Would love to have the option to choose car size on case of traveling with lots of luggages.",5,1
"An army of drivers, doesn't matter you are in downtown or far, far away, you always have a cab couple minutes from you, I'm living in São Paulo BTW.",5,1
It's hard to believe but I got all taxis in less than a minute. You make a request and a wild taxi appears in the same instant. Awesome. I am really impressed with this app and service.,5,1
"Does exactly what it says it does, and does it perfectly.
It gets you a cab in most places, usually under 5 minutes. Needs to be spread.",5,1
"Excelent app, very intuitive reliable and smart. You can find a taxi easier than with the old ways.",5,1
"The service needs adjustment, and so does the app. There's a gap for drivers to bail clients over the phone... Also there's no way to adjust the address... So if you're inside a mall and it has multiple entrances, you'll have to call or text the driver to let them know.",3,1
Works exactly as advertised and makes getting a taxi easy,5,1
"Love this app!  Gets us a taxi everywhere, with a short wait.  Awesome that you can see where your taxi is and when it will arrive.  Also love the electronic receipts via email.",5,1
"It is a great app works like a charm, just the gps location at times is off, not the apps fault. If you remember that you will never have an issue",5,1
As an app 99 works way better and is more reliable than the other ones.,5,1
"Efficient, fast and reliable. Always arrives within time period and plenty of drivers. Must have.",5,1
"Works as expected, saved me once I got in the wrong bus, got off in a weird place and this app managed to find my correct location and get me a cab with 2 minutes",4,1
"Very reliable, full of payment options and good deals. If you ever visit Brazil, this app is a must have. It's the best way to get around Rio and São Paulo. I confess that I haven't tried it in states yet.",5,1
Downloaded and used it yesterday. I am so impressed that I had to write this review. This is a fantastic app that I believe will use so much each time I am in SP.,5,1
"Of course it would be great if services like Uber and Lift were available here, but for now 99Taxis is well served of drivers and campaigns like Johnnie Walker's 
#hojenãodirijo are such a genius marketing move. Keep rocking, guys!",4,1
99 Taxi is excellent! I started using it when I got to São Paulo Brazil and it makes getting around the city much easier. I use all the time.,5,1
"Great app, tons of paying options and promotions. Definitely a must have.",5,1
"I'm using 99taxi for two months, this is the best app for taxi. We can pay without open the wallet, just putting the first cpf digits, it's very useful.",5,1
"Provides a very easy way to call, order and communicate with taxi's in Brazil.",5,1
"Fast, reliable and useful. That is how I usually define it. 5 stars to the app and the support team, which is also super efficient and kind.",5,1
"Works great, used it many times, never waited more than 5 mins for a cab, highly recommended!!",5,1
"Nice. Everything worked fine, as it should be. Ride was nice too, good driver, arrived on time. All good.",5,1
"I couldn't get a cab for 45 minutes so I downloaded the app, 5 minutes later - I'm on it!",5,1
"Great app, love that I receive a receipt after each ride !
Secure, quick, always works, and love that I can pay in app :)",5,1
Very quick to find a driver and reliable!,5,1
Excellent. The only thing is the usage of discount coupons. It is not very friendly.,5,1
Very good taxi app. Taxis tend to be a little more cleaner and recent than the average fleet.,5,1
"Amazing ! Works extremely well ! The service is user friendly, simple and very accurate !!!! The PayPal discount is a must !",5,1
"99Taxis is - by far - the most reliable taxi app in Brazil. It's fast, simple and intuitive.",5,1

"From all taxi apps in São Paulo, This is the best. Your taxi arrives in less than 5 minutes. Awesome!",5,1

Great app. Dependable and easy to use in many countries. Live time app with detailed receipts.,5,1
Works very well in all major cities in Brazil,5,1
Fully recommend!,5,1
Got no issues. Recommend.,5,1
"Although the app advertises the first ride for free I did not get this benefit. I send messages in both Portuguese and English and has not received a reply. Such a lie. 

Apesar do aplicativo mencionar a primeira corrida gratuita eu não recebi como o prometido. Contatei o serviço através do aplicativo em português e inglês e até agora não recebi resposta. Que vergonha.",1,0
"Set it up in less than 15sec, taxi got here in less than 20sec!

Very easy to use and very efficient!,5,1
"Easy to use, very intuitive UI; the taxi always knows who to look for.

Good alternative to Uber ;),5,1
I love this app ❤️,5,1
"During the rush hour, the app couldn't fins any taxis.  Forget one with Credit, any taxi.  You have a better chance to stop one on the road!",1,0
It does the job perfectly.,5,1
"Still a great app, but it was removed the promo payment option (Claro Clube, others), and replaced by ""Coupons"", which does not work.",1,0
"This is the best Taxi App here in Brazil, if you are a foreigner use it instead of Uber!",5,1
The app should let us save addresses like home address and edit it. Everytime drivers misunderstand the address,2,0

Is great to get taxis. There is always a cab near you,5,1

"Qdo comecei a usar os apps de corrida o padrão era todas as corridas com ar condicionado. Agora o padrão é vidro aberto e se pedirmos o ar condicionado o motorista ou te fuzila com o olhar ou inventa uma desculpa. Fora isso, a qualidade dos motoristas no geral caiu e acabei preferindo voltar a usar meu carro próprio. Uma pena!",4,1
"Usei o App anos atrás e já não tenho mais o número de celular.

A Ajuda deles só está disponível dentro App apos o login - parece piada, mas não é.
A unica Central telefonica que encontrei 0300 313-9999 nem completa a ligação.

"Muito tempo de espera, motoristas vivem cancelando depois de aceitarem a corrida por minutos. Ridículo e estressante.",1,0

"Desembarcando de um voo no aeroporto de Congonhas, pedi uma corrida com embarque na área coberta (piso inferior) e segui as instruções do app, chegando à área de embarque selecionada. O motorista, porém, quando marcou no app que tinha chegado, estava no local errado (como ele mesmo afirmou), que era a área descoberta do piso superior, na qual inclusive é permitido apenas desembarque e embarque de táxi, e não é permitido embarque de aplicativo de transporte. Fiquei 9 minutos esperando ele fazer uma volta, já que ele estava no local errado, e no final ele cancelou dizendo que estava na área descoberta (que não era o ponto de embarque correto que havia sido selecionado, pois estava chovendo e por isso eu selecionei a área coberta) e que não podia entrar na área coberta, o que NÃO É VERDADE pois esse era justamente o ponto que eu tinha SELECIONADO NO APLICATIVO e seguido AS INTRUÇÕES DO PRÓPRIO APLICATIVO PARA CHEGAR, além de ser a área corretamente INDICADA para embarque de transporte de aplicativo pelas PLACAS DO PRÓPRIO AEROPORTO. Recebi uma cobrança de taxa de cancelamento, quando em todo momento eu estava exatamente no local do ponto de embarque selecionado, no qual o motorista nunca chegou. Logo após pedi outra corrida e consegui rapidamente embarcar no mesmo local que eu estava, comprovando que eu estava no local correto. Não fui desrespeitada apenas pelo primeiro motorista que não foi para o local correto, mas também pela própria 99 que se recusa a resolver meu problema. Quando fui contestar a cobrança da taxa de cancelamento, recebi uma resposta automática dizendo que não seria possível o reembolso pois o motorista chegou ao local de embarque e esperou 9 minutos, sendo que esse tempo todo o motorista NUNCA chegou ao local de embarque correto, como ELE MESMO AFIRMA NOS PRINTS DO CHAT DO APLICATIVO e que inclusive é possível ver o DESVIO DE ROTA dele no print enquanto teoricamente já era pra ele ter chegado no local de ponto de embarque. Fiquei horas tentando resolver o problema e recebendo apenas respostas automáticas, depois horas esperando na fila de espera do chat de atendimento ao vivo do aplicativo, para no fim receber uma mensagem dizendo que analisaram minha solicitação mas apenas repetindo o mesmo texto da mensagem automática, o que claramente não é verdade, pois se realmente tivessem analisado veriam que a mensagem simplesmente não condiz com a realidade apresentada e comprovada pelos prints (que também poderiam ser verificados no chat que fica salvo no próprio aplicativo). O atendimento foi completamente ineficiente, ineficaz e inclusive des.onesto, já que enviaram uma resposta que não faz sentido. Fui completamente desrespeitada, já que sequer analisaram meu caso de fato depois de todas as horas que perdi. Exijo mais uma vez o meu reembolso, além da melhora dos canais de atendimento da 99, que no momento são completamente ineficazes. A 99 não está perdendo somente uma cliente assídua, mas toda a minha família que também costumava usar o app frequentemente, pois a 99 costumava ser a nossa primeira opção, mas depois de todo esse transtorno vemos que a empresa não leva o cliente a sério, além de ser completamente não confiável, já que o motorista pode dizer que chegou no embarque estando num lugar completamente diferente, cancelar a corrida e a 99 ainda vai cobrar do passageiro injusta e desonestamente.",1,0
"Podiam aceitar pagamento no app pelo Apple Pay, inclusive para pagamento de boleto. Podia ser uma opção o sistema de pagamentos de vocês é tão instável.",3,1
"Aplicativo ficou inutilizável, não consegui usar na última vez. Foi desesperador, pois tinha pressa para pegar um táxi. 
O aplicativo gerava erro para pagar com Apple Pay o adicional de uma corrida antiga (que já foi uma surpresa enorme). Meu cartões cadastrados estavam vencidos e não tinha em mãos para atualizar. 
Com isso, não conseguia nem pedir corrida para pagar no próprio táxi. 
Até agora não encontrei onde atualizo os cartões. 
E para piorar, a cada tela alterada aparecida um pop-up de promoção, aviso, desconto, etc. 
Devia ter uma opção de descartar e não voltar a aparecer.",1,0

Não da mais para escolher carro com motorista mulher, o que, para clientes mulheres, é de extrema importância; não da mais para escolher carro pet-friendly, o que, para clientes donos de pet também é de extrema importância; agora é obrigatório informar o destino da corrida para chamar um táxi, o que, na cidade do Rio de Janeiro, é um grande problema, visto que aqui é comum os motoristas escolherem corrida pelo destino dos clientes, que, diga-se de passagem, é PROIBIDO por lei.

Mas o pior: os taxis sumiram!
Ao concluir a entrada se origem, destino e tipo de pagamento, o aplicativo busca os taxis (como na versão anterior), mas os taxis sumiram!
E, sim, tem taxi na redondeza. Estou no centro de São Paulo, durante o dia, em dia útil.
Como me arrependo de ter atualizado o app.",1,0
"A última versão (6.2.2) ficou uma porcaria.
1) Meu histórico de corridas foi zerado;
2) Recuou-se a trabalhar com o cartão de crédito que já estava sendo usado;
3) Sumiu com a opção de gorjetas;
4) Perdeu a integração com o app VAH;
Update 6/Fev:
5) Os descontos promocionais não estão funcionando.",1,0
"1) Não tem opção de siar da conta.

2) Não tem como colocar o endereço exato.

3) Está com bug, quando chamo o motorista ele aparece o tempo estimado portando esse tempo não diminui e do nada o aplicativo avisa que o motorista está aguardando fora.",1,0
Com a atualização meu cadastro simplesmente desapareceu. Ao abrir o app ele pede para iniciar um cadastro e... surpresa! Informa que o e-mail já está em uso e não consigo mais usar. Péssimo.,1,0
"Aplicativo pensado nas pessoas: transparente, facil de usar, respeita o usuário. Resolvem todo tipo de problema e sao muito atenciosos, ao contrario do Uber.",5,1
"O aplicativo atualizou sozinho. Sumiu com meu histórico de corridas, deletou meus endereços e não chama mais o táxi sem destino. Nem tem a opção de pagamento com crédito ou débito no táxi.
Horrível",1,0
"Piorou muito após a recente atualização o App ficou uma cópia do uber, e àquilo que o diferenciava já não existe mais. Principalmente o fato de ser obrigatório a colocação do endereço de destino no App e para o motorista está mais complicado para ele entender qual é exatamente o ponto em que eu estou.",2,0
"Não baixem/atualizem!! Não consigo mais encontrar endereço na busca, sumiram todo meu historico e enderecos salvos! O SAC é padrao, não ajudaram em nada",4,1
"A opção de levar cães sumiu sem nenhum aviso. Sem a opção PET o passageiro depende do motorista aceitar ou não, o que gera grande estresse, ou seja, impossibilita o uso. Isto reduz o bem estar dos donos e dos animais. Espero que retomem logo a opção.",1,0
"É inacreditável como a empresa vem conseguindo PIORAR este que já foi um dos melhores aplicativos de táxi do Brasil.

Esta nova versão está terrível, o GPS simplesmente não funciona direito, hoje levei 25 minutos para conseguir pedir um táxi, atividade que em mais de 4 anos de usuário nunca levou mais de 2 minutos.

Se vocês estão tentando quebrar a empresa e perder todos os clientes, parabéns vocês estão no caminho certo, pois acabaram de perder um cliente que usava 2 Táxis por dia com vocês já há mais de 4 anos.

Conheço outros usuários e eles estão passando pelos mesmos problemas! Tenho curiosidade de saber como é o processo de QA de vocês, pois aparentemente ele não existe.",1,0
"New update missing Pet friendly drivers!!! I’m so angry!
Nova atualização sumiu com a opção de motoristas que aceitam transporte de Pets. 
Estou muito irritado!!!",1,0
E não sei onde verifico a opção de pagamento!,5,1
"Quando pedi a corrida apareceu 45,00 e fui cobrada por 56,00",1,0
99 era o melhor aplicativo. Hoje virou uma bela merda. Pior serviço com o preço mais caro e disfarçando extorsão como benefício. Parabéns.,1,0
"Não possui uma área de abrangência significativa em São Paulo, pouca disponibilidade, bugs, não demonstra estimativa de preço da viagem, preço maior do que os de concorrentes. Além disso muitas mensagens de spam tanto no app quanto no e-mail!",1,0
Muito bom,5,1
"Parabéns pela equipe que fica no saguão do embarque Galeão. Jovens super educados, simpáticos e eficientes!!!! Parabéns",5,1
"Desde a última atualização tenho enfrentado muitos problemas, desde corridas abertas em que o motorista não sabe que a corrida é dele, até corridas canceladas pelo motorista ou pelo próprio sistema onde o app ainda sugere que seja dada uma gorjeta.",5,1
Um absurdo a forma como vcs fazem esse pagamento. Eu pedi um motorista e o valor era pra ser mais ou menos 11 reias. Quando ele fechou a corrida deu 35 reais. Não tinha trânsito nem nada. Um roubo isso! Costumo pegar Uber todos os dias para ir e voltar do trabalho e peguei o 99 um dia para testar e vcs são uns ladroes! Bando e sem noção q cobra mais q 100% do valor mostrado! Se depender de mim vocês nunca mais vão ter clientes.,1,0
"Solicitei um carro e veio um táxi velho, com motorista de táxi típico (sujo e não respeita leis de trânsito). Nunca mais utilizarei.",1,0
"Com muita frequência motoristas cancelam corridas, sem que haja da parte do App nenhuma penalidade. Pelo que ouvi de motoristas, se alguém dá sinal na rua, eles cancelam a corrida e pegam o passageiro na rua por uma melhor compensação",3,1
Esperei mais de 20 minutos por um carro que era para demorar 7 minutos. Os últimos 10 minutos de espera o carro não mudou de local. E além não respondeu para dizer o que estava acontecendo. Infelizmente não usarei mais.,1,0
"Aceitar com normalidade é ótimo mas Incentivar e glamorizar determinadas posições sociais em propagandas de cunho sexual extremamente como se fosse obrigatório ser gay para ser bacana é ridículo. Não sou homofóbico mas achei um exagero absurdo a propaganda homosexual pop. 
Fiquem com suas posições de INCENTIVO à homosexualidade. JAMAIS VOLTAREI A USAR 99",1,0
Usando no iPad Air. Não tem um lugar pra cancelar a corrida e o botão amarelo de confirmar cobre o preço dificultando a visualização do mesmo. Corrijam isso. Eh fácil e vai melhorar muito a utilização do app.,3,1
Aplicativo nao tem locais favoritos....,4,1
Muito bom motorista.,5,1
"A nova versão está instável, com muita dificuldade para definir local de embarque e destino.
Piorou muito!!!",2,0
Qdo solicito o carro o preço é muito menor q a tarifa final,4,1
"Coisas como um 99 família , contato mais eficaz c o motorista etc",3,1
"Está nova versão do aplicativo esta com problemas no GPS, dificulta tanto par o Cliente e principalmente para o motorista",2,0
"Nem cartão nem paypal. 
Não consigo usar o app.",1,0
Muito bom,5,1
"Sem Amex, só viagens pessoais.",5,1
"Para mim o pior app de táxi
Provavelmente vou parar de usar e não indico mais
Sempre da problema na opção que escolho ou com o taxista
E quando a gente quer resolver não resolvem nosso problema",1,0
App trava e não mostra motorista e veículo,1,0
Legal,5,1
99,5,1
"Alguns erros como na procura de carros , dão feedbacks não muito verbosos, não consigo ter certeza de qual foi o erro. De resto tudo ok!",4,1
"Recomendo uso quase todo dia porém se choveu, como todos os outros aplicativos, vai te deixar na mão....",1,0
Acabei de fazer uma corrida avaliada em 36 reais e cobraram 45 no meu cartão. Revoltada.,5,1
"Why not have the option to send code to email???
Does no good if you discover this app while traveling outside your phone’s country code!",1,0
"Alguns problemas têm acontecido: seleciona a corrida e o app reinicia sozinho, como se não houvesse táxi a caminho, GPS que indica que você está a quadras de distância do local correto... Mas ainda é o melhor aplicativo para pedir táxis, com a melhor interface para o usuário.",4,1
"Que app ridículo, como não tem opção de sair da conta? Tenho que apagar o app para sair da minha conta?",1,0
Realmente a 99 está se superando! Além dos melhores preços e do aplicativo são os mais confiáveis do mercado. Recomendo de boca cheia !,5,1
"Não consigo finalizar o cadastro nem fazer o login!
Há meses baixo o App e reinstalei mas não consigo utilizar!!",1,0
"O app fica mandando propagandas como notificações. Não tem como manter as notificações ligadas. Só habilito as notificações se chamo um carro, pra depois ter que desabilitar, muito ruim isso.",3,1
Melhor que uber,5,1
"Prático e rápido, muitos motoristas disponíveis. Recomendo",5,1
Solução nacional que funciona melhor que o uber. Apoio.,5,1
"Eu preciso usar o aplicativo agora e ele não me envia o sms pra cadastrar!!! Pensei que fosse rápido, se demorar muito vou optar pelo uber mesmo",2,0
App feita por gente competente!,5,1
"Você pede taxi e quando chega NUNCA é o carro descrito na chamada. Além disso, por diversas vezes chamei e o motorista simplesmente nunca chegava. PÉSSIMO SERVIÇO!",4,1
Ótimo opção de taxi com bons descontos.,5,1
Boa app. Bom serviço. Carros geralmente novos. Motoristas profissionais.,5,1
"Tiraram a opção de desconto e colocaram uma que se paga 10 reais a mais! Nunca mais usarei!

Cada dia piora as vantagens pra quem usa taxi! 
Cada dia um problema novo!
Hj iniciaram uma corrida sem eu estar no carro! Ao ligar o motorista falou que pegou o passageiro errado. 
Cada dia mais decepção!",1,0
"Aplicativo deixa a desejar em relação aos concorrentes. Os descontos não são aplicados corretamente. O aplicativo não tem um canal direto para reclamações. Na verdade, a resposta automática da reclamação manda um link e neste link não se consegue logar para reclamar. Sugiro o easy Taxi.",1,0
O melhor app em termos de design e usabilidade. Peço que as promoções aconteçam frequentemente pois é uma excelente surpresa contar com essas ofertas constantes.,5,1
Cancelei corrida e não cancelou... Chamei outro motorista e vieram os dois... corrida cancelada do lado do cliente e ativa do lado do motorista. Só quero ver a conta no cartão.,2,0
O aplicativo tem um bom serviço e ótimos preços.,5,1
Vários descontos para incentivar novos usuários e a opção de trocar mensagens entre o motorista e o passageiro é muito interessante,5,1
Muito mais moderno. Muito mais pratico. Com muitos descontos e incentivos para passageiros e motoristas. A ferramenta de troca de mensagem entre passageiros e motorista é ótima. Enfim. Pra mim o melhor app de transporte da Apple parabéns 99,5,1
Seri bom tem uma forma de gerar relatório de despesas para empresa e também comprr crédito antecipado com desconto para uso por equipes,5,1
Ótimo app! Até hoje nunca me deixou na mão. Motoristas e carros muito bons. E muitas promoções.,5,1
"Adorei o aplicativo, ja recebi vários cupons de desconto e todos funcionaram perfeitamente bem! Super recomendo!",5,1
"O aplicativo me cobrou R$ 5,00 só por tentar utilizar um cupom de desconto. Já informei meu cartão da cobrança ilegal e se insistirem abrirei um processo de cobrança indevida e danos morais.",1,0
O aplicativo atende apesar de não ser o melhor. Ruim mesmo é o serviço dos taxistas. Este sim é péssimo em boa parte das vezes.,1,0
"Muitas vezes eu preciso de taxi, quero usar corredor, ou simplesmente não ter que ficar explicando o caminho para um motorista inexperiênte. Sem contar a sensação de insegurança em entrar em um carro de passeio com um estranho não credenciado legalmente como motorista. Ou seja, eu quero ter a opção de não receber POP quando peço TAXI. Isso acaba com a transparência do aplicativo. Se continuar acontecendo vou desinstalar como fiz com o Easy e procurar outra opção.",2,0
"Mto bom, facilita a vida de quem utiliza taxi.",5,1
"É melhor que chamar táxi na rua porém Uber é melhor.

Enganação:
-Antes havia estimativa mínima e máxima (sempre era a máxima ao terminar a corrida). Agora você tem apenas estimativa mínima do tipo ""corrida vai custar PELO MENOS R$ X"". Fazem isso pra você achar que vai sair mais barato que Uber mas na verdade o preço sempre é maior, inclusive quando é hora pico. 
-O tempo de espera é sempre o dobro do estimado.

Pra quem mora em SP, existe uma opção muito interessante que é de carro particular. Pra passageiro é mais barato que Uber e pra motorista, a comissão é a metade do que a Uber cobra. 

Tirando essa opção, vá de Uber.",2,0
"Aplicativo prático, de fácil operação. Recomendo.",5,1
"Taxista saiu do caminho e a corrida custou 15 reais mais cara. Resposta do suporte da 99? ""Sentimos muito"".",1,0
"A 99 manda desconto para o carnaval, porém não encontrei o compus de preencher o desconto. Inclusive o motorista do 99pop não sabia me informar",1,0
"Aplicativo fraco, super limitado. Sem possibilidade de resolução de problema. A concorrência tá muito melhor.",2,0
"A nova atualizaçao te pergunta se você quer receber notificações 2x a cada vez que você abre o aplicativo. Se eu selecionei essa opção, estou ciente da escolha!!! Me deixe usar o aplicativo em paz.",1,0
"Tenho recebido um aviso de corrida que não pode ser cobrada. Eu não fiz essa corrida... e venho tentando enviar mensagem pelo aplicativo e não consigo porque o botão de envio fica permanentemente desabilitado. E, sem resolver, não consigo usar voucher de promoção. Me ajudem a resolver, pfv",1,0
"Não consigo cadastrar o pagamento em PayPal, e já tentei contato via e-mail e sem retorno algum.",1,0
O programa não está permitindo inserir um endereço de destino que já não esteja na minha lista. Inviabiliza o uso.,5,1
"Cuidado!!!
Fui cobrada em valor muitíssimo superior (não sei se por problema no aplicativo ou por falha do motorista em encerrar a corrida). Tentei contato por diversos canais, mas sem retorno.",1,0
Demora demais pra achar taxi e quando acha eles demoram muito pra chegar. Quase fui assaltada outro dia tentando chamar um taxi por mais de meia hora as 22hrs no CENTRO DE SAO PAULO. Como não tinha nenhum??? Muito ruim.,2,0
"Ótima opção para quem não quer pegar Uber e quer permanecer nos táxis 
Veja bem
Já usei Uber e com 99, 1 a cada dez taxistas não prestam, mas é só avaliar ele ruim q ele nunca mais vem pra você :) nada a reclamar a não ser realmente do tempo de espera que sempre é maior do que o esperado",5,1
Funciona muito bem,5,1
"Nota zero, por varias vezes tentei pedir um carro pelo aplicativo, com tarifa reduzida e SEMPRE vinha como resposta que nao havia carros disponíveis. No início fui muito bem atendido, mas agora o serviço está deixando a desejar.",1,0
"Preferido pelos taxistas, substitui o Easytaxi definitivamente pelos serviços da 99taxis.
Só precisa aceitar mais cartões de crédito ao invés de apenas um. Nesse quesito a Easytaxi ganha.",5,1
"99 tem se mostrado o melhor aplicativo para táxis disponível. A equipe atendeu as reclamações feitas aos motoristas, ao contrário de outras empresas como EasyTaxi que não dão a mínima aos usuários. Parabéns!",5,1
É bom mas o uber eh melhor,5,1
É um bom aplicativo. Vale a pena ter. Show de bola!,5,1
"Adoro o app! Mas queria muito a opção de deixar os meus endereços favoritos salvos de uma vez! É muito chato e demorado ter que usar o app para gravar os endereços. Tenho mais de 12 endereços que já gostaria de deixar salvo no aplicativo. Por favor, trabalhem nisso para facilitar nosso dia a dia.",4,1
Mais rápido y não tem trânsito,5,1
"App muito bom, bons motoristas e resposta muito rápida!",5,1
Amazing,5,1
"Rápido, prático e eficiente!",5,1
Passageiro 99 desde sempre. A modernização que todos queriam já existe há muito tempo. 99 é o aplicativo de/para quem trabalha de verdade.,5,1
App muito bom!,5,1
O melhor aplicativo de taxi.,5,1
Não aconselho... Muito ruim! Chama sempre taxi mais longe...,1,0
"Prático e rápido, muito útil. Ainda mais quando oferecem descontos",5,1
Serviço excelente e finalmente a solução para pagamentos on line em serviço público!,5,1
Muito bom aplicativo!,5,1
Otimo,5,1
Uso demais. Muito bom.,4,1
Melhor opcao para quem esta como turista e não conhece a região pois o app te da a rota e valor aproximado de cobrança da corrida.,5,1
"Super rápido e confiável,",5,1
Parabéns pelo app. Excelente,5,1
Muito bom é fácil de usar!!!!,5,1
Não é do PT.,5,1
Excelente,5,1
Sempre resolve alcança minhas expectativas! 👍🏻,5,1
Muito bom. Boa cobertura.,5,1
Tive uma péssima experiência com um taxista e a empresa responsável pelo App não fez nada com o motorista. Não me sinto seguro,1,0
Mais caro,3,1
"Não sei mais viver sem a comodidade do 99 taxis. Com o app, não preciso mais sair do conforto da minha casa para pedir um táxi ou fazer ligações telefônicas para cooperativas. Além disso, o pagamento diretamente no aplicativo traz a tranquilidade de não precisar sacar dinheiro para me deslocar.",5,1
Irado! Que venha agora o 99TOP!!!,5,1
App pra todas as horas,5,1
Excelente serviço,5,1
"Foram laçadas corridas em meu cartão de crédito, sem eu nunca ter utilizado o aplicativo. Fui obrigado a cancelar o cartão.",1,0
"Muito bom, rápido, pratico e seguro.",3,1
"Único, nunca falha! Melhorou a qualidade do transporte executivo por si só!",5,1
"Nao permiti logar com conta existente - sempre leva a criar uma nova. Daí perde as informacoes de pagamento e do corporativo

Feature de inserir o endereço para o motorista via app não funciona",3,1
Gostei do app,5,1
"Bom aplicativo, mas o GPS falha por vezes, gerando confusão no atendimento.
Mesmo assim, vale a pena, pois é prático e seguro",4,1
App muito bom!! Não tenho do que reclamar.,5,1
Aplicativo simples e muito fácil de usar. O serviço é o melhor que tem. Excelente.,5,1
Funciona muito bem no Rio de Janeiro.,5,1
"Adorei voltar para o Brasil e encontrar inovações na maneira de conseguir um táxi. Adoro tb os cupons de desconto que são fáceis de conseguir, muito vezes usei e não paguei nada pela corrida. Super recomendo.",5,1
Muito bom o aplicativo!,5,1
Muito bom!,5,1
"O taxi sempre chega rápido, a forma de pagamento é excelente pois não preciso mais me preocupar em ter dinheiro e ainda consigo carregar meu celular durante a corrida...D+",5,1
Nunca consigo conectar com 4g somente com wifi !,5,1
"Muito bom mesmo, rapido demais",5,1
"Quando escolho o meio de pagamento Johnny Walker, ele me leva a uma página em que preencho alguns dados, então aparece que está ok e que tenho direito a desconto, mas depois volta para a página de escolher meio de pagamento. Se tento de novo dá o mesmo problema.",2,0
Achei meu iPhone graças ao recibo automático que recebi contendo a placa do veículo. Obrigado 99! Obrigado Vlademir! FKD7919!,5,1
"Minha rua é mão única tem uns 15 anos. Apesar disso, apesar de eu ter avisado a 99Táxi algumas vezes do problema, mesmo assim o mapa continua indicando aos taxistas credenciados para entrar na contra-mão. Fora esse tipo de problema, é um bom app.",4,1
"Aplicativo muito eficiente e funcional. A única queixa é dos sms que demoram a ser enviados. No mais, o aplicativo eh excelente.",5,1
"Deveriam criar uma funcionalidade para parentes ou amigos receberem também, como segurança,  os dados do motorista, local e hora do embarque.
Usar rastreamento de pagamento com débito e credito, evitando máquinas de clonagem de cartão.
Melhor serviço de táxi em são paulo!",5,1
Muito bom aplicativo ! Sempre uso e sempre dá certo,5,1
Muito pratico,5,1
"Muitos taxistas disponíveis, ótimo design do app, fácil de usar",5,1
"O aplicativo deveria ter um passcode para visualizar os
Cartões de Credito cadastrados.

No mais, muito bom.",4,1
Parabéns pelo aplicativo! Muito bom!👏🏻,5,1
"Quando comparado com aplicativos concorrentes como o EasyTaxi o 99 se sobressai, pois o taxista que vem é O MAIS PRÓXIMO, não o primeiro a atender o pedido. Tem 20% de desconto em toda corrida paga pelo cartão de crédito e tem vários cupons de desconto! Ótimo.",5,1
"Péssima primeira impressão, baixei ontem pois precisava urgente de um táxi e não consegui um carro, fiz varias tentativas.",1,0
Eu já experimentei outros apps de taxi mas o 99 é o melhor.,5,1
Serviço rápido e preço justo! Gosto muito.,4,1
Sei não,3,1
"Usava muito o app, até esta última experiência. Tentei táxi durante 25 minutos para ir de SP à São Bernardo. Dos taxistas que atenderam o chamado, um errou sucessivas vezes o caminho, se distanciando cada vez mais. Os outros dois simplesmente não saiam do ponto. Em nova tentativa, o app retornava como ""Sem táxi disponível"", com a mesma mensagem várias vezes. 
Por fim baixei o easytaxi e finalmente consegui um. 
Péssima experiência pra um cliente constante.",1,0
Não carrego dinheiro e só posso pagar no cartão. Não acho que o tempo estimado funcione bem em nenhum momento mas a parte virtual do carro andando vale. De resto tudo otimo,5,1
Usando paypal ainda ganha 20% de desconto na corrida,5,1
Recomendo a todos!,5,1
"Entre abrir o aplicativo e chegar o taxi não se passaram 5minutos. Segurança para mim e principalmente para o motorista. Claro que vai depender de sua localidade, local isolado será mais lento.",5,1
Nunca deixou furo !,5,1
Muito mal vocês terem tirado o cartão de crédito para pagamento e nos obrigar a ter conta no Paypal. Lamentável,5,1
Simplesmente essencial para qualquer ocasião.,5,1
"E se algo dá errado, tenho feedback imediato da central.",5,1
"... Mas não raro o taxi que aceita a corrida está muito longe (e com pressa fica inviável aguardar). Se cancelar a corrida e isso acontecer novamente, nem pense em cancelar. Perca o seu compromisso e aguarde o taxi vir do fim do mundo, pois se cancelar mais de duas vezes, v. é bloqueado. Não raro uso o Easy Taxi, pois o 99 dá esse tipo de problema. Uma pena, pois o aplicativo, no geral, é bom.",1,0
Ótimo app. Continuem com os cupons. Estimulam muito o uso.,4,1
"Na verdade o aplicativo não aceita pagamento com cartão de crédito. Na verdade você é obrigado a abrir uma conta no PayPal. 
Como eu não quero este tipo conta apaguei o aplicativo. 
Recomendo o Easy Taxi que aceita cartão de crédito.",1,0
"20% de desconto, sempre tem taxi bem perto e nunca dá problema pra pagar. Depois de conhecer esse aplicativo, abandonei o Easy Taxi, que sempre dava vários problemas pra pagar",5,1
"Eles realmente se preocupam com os clientes, e se acontece de aparecer um taxista ruim, eles realmente falam com o mesmo! Serviço ao cliente PERFEITO!! Parabéns!",5,1
Rápido e eficiente,5,1
"Uso diário, sem estresse. Fácil e rápido.",5,1
Pedi táxi pelo aplicativo e funcional td rápido e de forma prática!,5,1
Prático e ágil. Muito bom.,5,1
"Uma nova maneira de relacionar-se com os motoristas: de forma direta, não mais existindo a operadora da central de radiotáxi, a qual muitas vezes (a grande maioria) deixava a desejar... Parabéns 99Taxis pela excelência do serviço prestado por esse aplicativo!!! Obrigado...",5,1
As diversas promoções e o pagamento via PayPal são revolucionários. Parabéns pessoal!,5,1
"Melhor app de taxi do Brasil! Fácil e confiável, tem sempre as melhores promoção e descontos via paypal/crédito. Virei fã!!!",5,1
"Conheci o app por patrocinar o Cruzeiro, e não me deixou na mão. Taxi na minha casa em menos de dois minutos!",5,1
"Eu amo o 99, me ajuda todos os dias a pegar taxi. O melhor deste aplicativo é que eu sei quanto tempo o taxista vai demorar para me buscar, é fácil me comunicar com o taxista, caso necessário e eu me sinto muito mais segura para pegar taxi. Continuem melhorando o app!!",5,1
Nunca funciona ! Sempre buga,1,0
Baixei pelo patrocínio do Corinthians!,4,1
"Conheci o app por este ter fechado patrocínio com o Corinthians. Se mostrou uma excelente aquisição pela facilidade e funcionalidade. Clube com dinheiro, torcedor feliz e app divulgado.",5,1
"Muito bom , e super prático recomendo a todos",5,1
Sempre que precisei funcionou,5,1
App muito bom! Todos os taxistas sao gente fina!,5,1
Funciona perfeitamente! Já usei várias vezes e nunca me deixou na mão.,5,1
"funciona direitinho. pagamento com paypal. nao precisa de dinheiro ou cartao na mao, rapido e eficiente.",5,1
"Tanto no Rio quanto em SP nunca me deixou na mão. Fácil de usar, sem complicação...",5,1
Estava cansada de não ser atendida por rádio táxis. O aplicativo funciona muito bem em São Paulo! Nunca tive problema!,5,1
Comecei a usar por causa do patrocínio! Aplicativo funciona mt bem tanto em SP quanto no RJ! Principalmente para pagamento por cartao de credito!,1,0
Super rápido e de confiança.,5,1
Realmente de todos que ja usei é o melhor!,5,1
"O aplicativo é bom mas NÃO seleciona os PROFISSIONAIS que trabalham por eles! Ao solicitar uma corrida um motorista que me parecia um b**dido, quando questionei sobre a volta que estava dando para chega ele exaltado  me responde: 
- você sabe com quem você tá falando ! Fica na sua ai! 
mal vestido mal falava português...Um pequeno resumo do que passei 
Cuidado!",1,0
Aplicativo muito bom!!!,5,1
"Uma palavra: 
Competência!",5,1
App útil e funciona muito bem. Evita problemas na hora de achar um Táxi.,5,1
Uma mão na roda. Poder pagar com PayPal é a melhor coisa.,5,1
falta de comprometimento dos taxistas. TODAS as vezes que eu tentei pedir um taxi na emergência os taxistas aceitavam as corridas e cancelavam. Desisto.,5,1
Excelente app! Largamente utilizada por taxistas em SP e com boa aceitação! Uso sempre que preciso de um táxi e pouquíssimas vezes tive problemas. Uma ótima opção e sem custos adicionais!!!! :-),4,1
"Meu primeiro app de taxi. E agora que já tive a oportunidade de usar várias vezes, muito provavelmente o último também. =]",5,1
"Esse é ""O"" aplicativo!! Mudou a minha vida no quesito solicitação de taxi. E vai mudar a sua tambem. Muito, mas muito prático e intuitivo. Te dá total segurança, mostra até a placa do carro do taxi que vai te pegar. O taxi demorou? Sem problemas você cancela e pede outro! Você pode pagar via PayPal. Quer mais praticidade que isso? Nem dinheiro nem cartão! Não imaginei que fosse ver um app assim tão cedo.",5,1
"Da de 10 na concorrência. Mostra a posição dos táxis, rápido e eficiente.",5,1
"Aplicativo bom, porém a empresa falha ao instruir os motoristas a não cobrar adicional, a não chegar no cliente já com o taxímetro ligado e sem avisar.",1,0
apenas,5,1
😍😍😍,5,1
"Nunca esperei mais que 5 minutos. 
Funciona muito bem.",5,1
Aplicativo show para pedir e gerenciar pagamentos de taxi.,5,1
Principalmente P qm precisa de pagar c cartão...,5,1
"Excelente aplicativo -- seguro para ambas as partes, permite escolher diferentes formas de pagamento e mostra em tempo real a localização do carro. Brilhante !",5,1
Melhor app de táxi hoje! Recomendo,5,1
"Pior app! Nunca consigo completar uma chamada! Trava , taxistas cancelam! Nao recomendo! Desconto nao funciona!",1,0
"Muito lento e só trava, vontade de deletar depois que o taxista não vem !!!",1,0
Ótimas promoções!,5,1
Usei 5 vezes e deu tudo certo. Muito rápido e paguei com cartão.. Show!,5,1
"Qualquer aplicativo pode travar... Este não é diferente - e não trava frequentemente. Sempre usei e nunca tive problemas... Em SP, Fortaleza, Porto Alegre, Curitiba... Sempre funcionou!",4,1
Sempre da problema,1,0
"Ótimo aplicativo, muito bom e bem intuitivo! A integração com o FB é show! Vai uma dica para ser melhor! No histórico de corridas podia ter o valor da corrida! Assim facilita para quem precisa prestar contas com a empresa!",5,1
Nossa pessimo! Taxistas mal educados! Aplicativo trava! Prefiro usar o Easy taxi,1,0
"O App já era bom, agora com a parceria com a Claro Clube, que oferece 50% de desconto (limitado a R$25) na suas corridas, ele merece as 5 estrelas e minha indicação!",5,1
Utilizei hoje duas vezes e em menos de 10 min o taxi chegou! Maravilha! 😍,5,1
Não precisa de nenhum outro!!,5,1
"Não falha nunca e sempre me salva! 
Mais rápido que qualquer disk taxi!",5,1
"Muito fácil simples e sugestivo, melhor jeito de pedir taxi, parabéns pros desenvolvedores e pela ideia genial",5,1
"Todas as vezes que solicitei foi rápido, taxistas educados, ótimo.",5,1
App muito bom facilita tanto para o profissional quanto para os usuários de taxi!,5,1
Este app muda a vida das pessoas que precisam de taxi! Perfeito!!!,5,1
Muito bom!,5,1
Excelentemente ótimo,5,1
Excelente e muito prático. Nunca falhou comigo.,5,1
Funciona muito bem em SP,5,1
"Ja usei em alguns Estados e sempre funcionou bem, muito prático.",5,1
Melhor app de taxi!,5,1
Muito bom. Uso dia sim e dia não e nunca tive problemas.,5,1
Demais!,5,1
"Parabéns !!! Muito bom , eficiente !!! Meus parabéns",5,1
"Um dos melhores apps no qual já tive contato. Fácil, ágio, faz o que se propõe e mais!",5,1
Sempre que saio de qualquer lugar uso esse app,5,1
Aplicativo muito bom e com maior número de táxis disponíveis.,5,1
"Excelente serviço, tem funcionado bem. Ainda tenho que testar num dia de chuva.",5,1
Na minha opinião o 99 é o melhor App para pedir taxi.,5,1
Otimo,5,1
"Deveria ter como no aplicativo concorrente, como deixar comentários sobre os taxistas. Já tive alguns chamados cancelados nos últimos metros antes de chegar no pronto de partida. Isso me deixa emputecida! Em contrapartida, muitos dos taxistas são uns fofos. Simpatissisimos, adoraria  pontua los positivamente. Erecomenda los se possível.",5,1
"O app funciona direitinho. Mas muitas vezes o GPS nao funciona perfeitamente, o q acaba exigindo q vc digite o endereço. Deveria ter as funções de guardar os últimos endereços de onde vc chamou, ou pelo menos ter um endereço de ""casa"" por default. 
Ultimamente tenho tido dificuldade em conseguir taxis, assim como algumas corridas canceladas por taxistas, o que eh frustrante, mas não tem a ver com a funcionalidade do aplicativo.",4,1
"Fiquei impressionado com o serviço excelente funciona mesmo, muito seguro",5,1
Adorei...,5,1
Funciona !!!,5,1
"App funciona muito bem. Falta mesmo uma maneira de avaliar o taxista, peguei um hoje que pelo amor de Deus!",4,1
Você tem toda a segurança pois é enviado um email com as informações do taxista também é enviado a nota fiscal. Super recomendo.,5,1
"O serviço funciona muito bem. Você não perde tempo e ainda fica com os dados do taxista, caso esqueça algo no veículo. Realmente, quem criou este aplicativo merece elogios.",5,1
Serviço bastante eficiente. Recomendo.,5,1
Sugiro uma possibilidade de avaliar os taxistas.,5,1
Ja usei varias vezes e funciona.  Raramente o taxista cancela.,5,1
"App eh bom, mas recentemente os taxistas que chamo, falam que vao e nao aparecem, ai temos que cancelar a corrida e o 99taxis so penaliza quem cancela e nao o taxista que nao apareceu.",1,0
"Excelente aplicativo.
Interface amigável
Ótimo serviço de localização
Recomendo!!!",5,1
"Ótimo App! 
Recomendo!!!",5,1
Excelente!!,5,1
"Após 1 hora de espera e sem acesso à rede, 99 Táxis levou 5 mim e funcionou! Super recomendo!!!",5,1
Nunca mais usei rádio taxis,5,1
"Ha tempos aguardava uma oportunidade mais tranquila que me permitisse testar este servico.
Excelente, confiavel e seguro. Recomendo!",5,1
"muito bom aplicativo, fácil, intuitivo, prático... recomendo a todos que utilizam taxi... sem dúvidas o melhor jeito de chamar um taxi...",5,1
Uma das melhores idéias de app,5,1
"Muito bom aplicativo, mesmo quando usado no Rio aonde muitos taxistas fogem da corrida. Com o 99  nunca tive uma corrida recusada.",5,1
"O app é muito bom, mas deveria ter uma possibilidade de avaliar os taxistas pois já está ficando cansativo em 50% das corridas fica esperando o cara pq ele está fazendo outra coisa, aceitam corrida e vai abastecer, aceitam corrida e mandam mensagem que estão terminando a anterior, se eu quisesse esperar 20m eu iria de ônibus.",3,1
"O serviço não é 99, é 1000.
Tranquilo, rápido e fácil.
Recomendo",5,1
Já havia experimentado outros aplicativos para chamar taxi mas o Taxi99 superou minhas expectativas.,4,1
"Funciona perfeitamente, confiavel, facil de usar. Excelente.",5,1
Excelente app. Confiável e com uma base de táxis enorme.,5,1
Aplicativo excelente!,5,1
Perfeito. Usem sem medo.,5,1
"Olá, acho que uma boa funcionalidade é que após as corridas pudéssemos avaliar os taxistas. E que essa avaliação fosse visível para os usuários. Assim como os taxistas podem avaliar os clientes, e que isso também fique visível. Assim cada vez que uma das partes cancele a viagem isso seria pontuado. Muito taxista cancelando a viagem.",4,1
"Nos vacilos das cooperativas, ja salvou muito! Excelente",5,1
O melhor app para taxi.,5,1
Só falta cadastrar CC e automatizar a cobrança,4,1
Muito Bom!!! Rapido!!!,5,1

🔝🔝,5,1
"Ate agora, tenho tido boas experiencias c/ o App...",4,1
👍👍👍,5,1
"Tendo conquistado uma frota grande de taxistas, esse aplicativo encontra opções rápidamente. Eu costumava ficar procurando taxi na rua. Não mais. Parabéns aos desenvolvedores e empreendedores do aplicativo!",5,1
O app é excelente. Mas falta uma opção que busque por carros com bagageiro grande. Vale incluir em uma nova atualização.,4,1
Funciona mesmo!!,5,1
"Rapido e facil de ultilizar, 99 taxi ja me salvou muitas vezes! Com muitos taxistas cadastrados, é bem dificil que vc nao seja atendido.",5,1
O servico eh super util e funciona bem. Tem uma boa disponibilidade de taxistas em Sao Paulo.,5,1
"Rápido, as vezes chega antes do previsto. Cooperativas agora só a do aeroporto de Guarulhos...",5,1
Muito prático. Adeus ponto de Taxi.,4,1
Melhor aplicativo de taxi disparado,5,1
otimo aplicativo!,5,1
"Mesmo em Curitiba, onde a frota de táxis é pequena, a resposta é rápida e os taxistas confiáveis. Em dias de chuva complica um pouco, mas ainda assim, aprovado!",4,1
Mesmo com chuva!,1,0
Até agora me atendeu bem. Boa interface e entrega o que promete.,5,1
Excelente. Rápido e confiável. Recomendo.,3,1
Funciona melhor q qualquer empresa de taxi nunca falhou,5,1
"Eu perdi minha carteira de motorista e quando saio para beber algo com minha esposa só usamos esse app, nunca falhou, recomendo para quem quiser conforto e praticidade! 👋💢👊💢",5,1
"Ja usei varias vezes, nunca me deixou na mão. Altamente recomendável",5,1
"Muito bom, devia ter começado a utilizar antes.",5,1
"Pra quem curte ter controle na palma da mão, o 99 Taxi é ótimo para resolver pedidos emergenciais e em locais de difícil acesso.",5,1
Melhor jeito de chamar taxi sem ter que perder tempo esperando a central atender  o telefone!,5,1
Very convenient and reliable. Great service! // Muito confiável e conveniente. Ótimo serviço!,4,1
"Essa App é a pior de todas, apesar de ter bastante taxis cadastrados. Só conseguimos ver qual taxista aceitou a chamada, depois de confirmada. Não tem como ver histórico de corridas, fazer avaliação do taxista, etc. Prefiro o TaxiBeat!",1,0
Rápido !,5,1
Ótima app!,5,1
De viaje en brasil y funciono de maravilla. En menos de 1 minuto mi taxi llegó. Y lo mejor recibo electrónico.,5,1
Rápido e eficiente.,5,1
"Muito bom. Excelente, uso toda semana e em média o taxi demora menos de 7 minutos.",5,1
"Aplicativo muito bom! O taxi veio em apenas 10 minutos, recomendo!",5,1
"Excelente app, porem último update deteriorou qualidade do mapa (numeração de algumas ruas passaram a mostrar posição equivocada).",3,1
Eficiente e seguro!!!,5,1
"Eu não tenho do que reclamar, pois, estou satisfeito com o atendimento e rapidez!",4,1
"Dos app que usei é o mais eficiente, além de chegar rapidinho. Bacana também ver os taxistas, incluindo os mais velhos, curtindo o aplicativo. Típica situação ganha-ganha : )",5,1
Pode ficar melhor se tiver como avaliar e ser avaliado,5,1
"Nova versão muito pior p colocar endereço. Mais poluído tb.....

App funciona e uso muito mas piorou muito!!?

Review da versão antiga:
Funciona muito bem! Taxi vem rápido, acompanha pelo gps. Recomendo!",2,0

Até agora excelente!!!,4,1
Ainda mais em Sao Paulo... Uma bela mao na roda!,5,1
segunda de manha com chuva! taxi chegou em 5 minutos,5,1
Gostei de todo serviço!,5,1
"Chega rápido. Além disso, os taxistas são simpáticos e dispostos a fazer o melhor caminho!",5,1
muito bom! as vezes demora um pouco mas em geral funciona bem,5,1
"O aplicativo é um dos mais úteis no meu iPhone, uso várias vezes por dia. Você pede um táxi, o mais próximo responde e vem até você. Simples assim. Mas como usuário frequente algumas coisa me incomodam: (1) não adianta reportar bugs, eles não respondem; (2) o próprio formulário para reportar bugs tem um bug: não envia a mensagem - vc é obrigado a enviar um e-mail, que eles não respondem; (3) o mapa tem muitos erros - minha casa, por exemplo, é reportada a uma quadra de seu local real, confundindo os motoristas, que reclamam bastante do aplicativo de GPS que usam do seu lado, atrasando o atendimento; (4) como os mapas têm erros, invariavelmente o usuário precisa corrigir o endereço apontado pelo GPS, sob pena de não ser localizado - seria interessante que o aplicativo desse a opção de cadastrar alguns endereços fixos em vez de ""chutar"" errado. Independentemente desses problemas o aplicativo cumpre o seu papel, e livrou usuários e taxistas da ""escravidão"" dos pontos fixos ou centrais de rádio-táxi, que além de caras para os taxistas exigiam um alto grau de paciência dos usuários.",3,1
Faltam taxistas em Curitiba,5,1
Excelente!!!!,5,1
Pegar taxi em São Paulo nunca foi tão fácil!,5,1
"Forma revolucionaria de pedir taxi!!!
Usei varias vezes e nunca falhou!!",5,1
"Pedi em Campinas, chegou na hora e funcionou muito bem!",5,1
"Estou muito satisfeito! Os taxistas também, ao contrário do Easy Taxi o 99 Taxi não cobra nenhuma taxa dos a taxistas!
Já usei três vezes e em 2 minutos o taxis está disponível!
Recebo um e-mail com o telefone e a placa do carro!

Adorei!!! Radio Taxi nunca mais!",5,1
"Pratico e eficiente, recomendo",4,1
Excelente,5,1
gostei. em sao paulo funciona muito bem,5,1
Baixei hj e achei muito bom e facil,5,1
Nao recebo o SMS com o codigo de confirmacao pra poder pedir um taxi,1,0
Todas as vezes que utilizo funciona muito bem. Ótimo aplicativo.,5,1
"O serviço e ótimo, indica o local que o taxi esta, o que e super útil para mim que tenho uma tia idosa. Assim posso acompanhar o trajeto do taxi ate a chegada dela em casa.

O serviço e melhor que o concorrente, porque além de tudo, nao cobra do taxista a taxa de chamada de 2 reais e indica apenas os motoristas que aceitam o seu tipo de pagamento. Ótimo para o dia que voce nao tem dinheiro na carteira.

Adorei",5,1
Um dos aplicativos mais úteis para um smartphone. Fácil de usar e seguro.,5,1
"Melhor que o EasyTaxi, porém falta a possibilidade de escolher um carro maior se estivermos em mais de 4, para não precisarmos usar 2 taxis",5,1
Nunca esperei mais que 5 minutos por um taxi!! O serviço é excelente!!,5,1
"Ótimo aplicativo, muito rápido e seguro.",5,1
Excelente,5,1
Gostei,5,1
"Funciona, mas acabei de ver pela visão do taxista que o aplicativo divulga o sobrenome e o número de telefone do passageiro para o taxista. Isso jamais deveria ser permitido, especialmente no país em que vivemos.",1,0
"O melhor app para chamar taxi! O mais justo , pratico e não cobra doa taxistas como outros apps!",5,1
Adorei e foi rapido!,5,1
Serviço nota 10!!!,5,1
Serviço Excelente muito bom,5,1
"Chuva, SP, atrasada... Salvou minha vida !",4,1

"Muito melhor que qualquer radio taxi. Em São Paulo é a melhor coisa, so uso o 99 para pedir taxi agora, rápido, confiável e de graça!",5,1
Otimo,5,1

"App muito bom e confiavel. Porem, faltam algumas funcionalidades, comp guardar na memoria os ultimos enderecos digitados - o GPS sempre erra o endereço da minha residência, e preciso redigitá-lo todas as vezes.",4,1
Simplesmente o aplicativo mais legal que eu já baixei no iPhone. Funciona de verdade,5,1
Taxi por telefone acabou! Pode usar que é ótimo!,5,1
"Seguro, nunca tive problema com nenhum taxista. Ultimamente o sistema tem deixado a desejar quando diz uma coisa pra mim e outra para o motorista ou quando não atualiza o mapa com a localização do taxi.",3,1
Achei o taxi muito mais facil !!,5,1
Facilitou 100% na hora de chamar um taxi!,5,1
"Achei incrível e Muito rápido e eficiente ! A primeira vez o endereço estava errado e tive q cancelar, mas a segunda    Foi certeira ! PARABÉNS aos desenvolvestes !",5,1
"Aplicativo sensacional. Rápido, fácil de utilizar e muito completo. Te oferece opções de pagamento, apresenta o motorista, bem como sua rota até você. Recomendo.",5,1
Aplicativo sensacional!! Recomendo!!,5,1
"Super confiável, ótimos taxistas e não deixa a desejar em nada. Porém, o aplicativo deveria ao clicarmos na foto do motorista mostrar informações dele, como o número de telefone, placa do carro, qual modelo do carro e foto do motorista.",5,1
"Sempre funciona muito bem, além de ser bem mais seguro para pegar taxi",5,1
"Aplicativo ótimo. Ainda peca um pouco na precisão do mapa. As vezes não pega a localização correta do taxista, ou de quem chama. Mas vale a pena.",5,1
Funciona mto bem!!,5,1
"Serviço seguro, rápido e simples",5,1
Melhor opção! Principalmente porque para o taxista é de graça.,5,1
Adorei esse aplicativo. O melhor que já experimentei ate hoje. Super recomendado.,5,1

Mto msm. Recomendo.,5,1
Bem mais rápido que pedir pelo telefone.,5,1
Menos o GPS.,4,1
Serviço impecável!!,5,1
"Se tivesse convenio com minha empresa, eu nunca teria que lidar com as malditas cooperativas!",5,1
Testei hoje pela primeira vez e o taxi chegou em 5 min. E assim que chegou na portaria do meu prédio o aplicativo avisou e o motorista ligou no meu cel para avisar tb. Fantastico,5,1
"O táxi costuma chegar entre 2/5 minutos após a chamada. O aplicativo mostra a foto do motorista, nome e carro para facilitar a identificação. Adorei.",5,1
Depois q descobri esse aplicativo deixei de ficar ligando nos pontos de táxi.,5,1
Melhor de todos,5,1
Toda vez que uso é rápido e pratico . Recomendo e muito.,5,1
Muito bom o aplicativo! Busca os taxis mais proximos antes de confirmar a corrida e da a opcao da forma de pagamento. So tive boas experiencias.,5,1
"Muito bom, fácil de usar, informações corretas, rápido e seguro. Adorei e recomendo à todos!! 😄😄",5,1
"Muito util e facil de usar. Facilita demais!

"Otemoooooo, super funciona !!",5,1
"Realmente muito bom, uso bastante.
Extensa rede de taxis e fácil de usar.
Falta apenas um histórico de endereços, com marcação de favoritos, como Casa, Trabalho, etc.",4,1

"Muito eficiente, motoristas selecionados e atendimento muito rápido. Achei a solução para o meu caso.",5,1
O melhor de todos os apps de taxi! Vale a pena!,5,1
Funciona sempre,5,1
Melhor app de táxi disparado! Sempre acha carros disponíveis!,5,1
Não vivo sem!,5,1
"Sempre funciona. Acredito que poderia incentivar os motoristas a aderirem mais ao débito e crédito como meio de pagamento, em especial na zona Sul de São Paulo.",5,1
Excelente,5,1
"Funciona perfeitamente em São Paulo. O taxi chegou no tempo determinado! A atualização do GPS é um pouco lenta, acredito que devido a nossa internet de péssima qualidade.",4,1
Muito rápido para o taxi chegar e o aplicativo é também muito bom.,5,1
O melhor app para taxi em Sao Paulo,5,1
Já pedi taxis algumas vezes e sempre chegam em menos de 5 minutos. Vale a pena ter o App,5,1
Muito pratico e facil de usar,5,1
Muito bom!,5,1
"Pode melhorar em algumas coisas como pe a opcao de escolher o taxista como no taxi beat, e deixar as opçoes de pagamento mais clara em como usar, pois sempre peço com todas as opçoes ""checked"" e sempre vem motorista q nao aceita cartao. Acho t tbm falta uma mensagem personLizada p mAndar ao motorista.",4,1
Testei e adorei!,5,1
Uso diariamente por ser o melhor app para pedir taxi do mercado,5,1
"Usei 2x e funcionou muito rápido e muito bom. Vamos ver se assim segue. Legal o negocio de mostrar a foto e dar o cel do taxista, pra vc poder ligar e saber q realmente existe alguém nesse chamado. O software me pareceu tbm de simples manuseio. Muito bom.",5,1
Mto bon,5,1
"Muito bom mas em dia de chuva, esquece",4,1

"Muito bom, só falta a funcionalidade de poder pagar pelo aplicativo!",5,1
O unico de sp que funciona de verdade!,5,1

Parabéns.",5,1
Muito bom!!!,5,1
Excelente,5,1

É ótimo ter o telefone do taxi para ligar e confirmar a corrida. Adorei!,1,0
Pratico. Rápido. E ainda posso escolher pagar meu taxi com debito. RECOMENDO.,5,1
Tive dois problemas com taxistas que aceitaram a chamada e não vieram me pegar. Mas isso é pouco em relação ao tanto que uso o app sem problemas. O sistema que localiza o taxi mais próximo já fez com que o carro chegasse inúmeras vezes mais rápido do que eu pudesse ficar pronto. Uso e recomendo.,4,1
"Fácil de operar e muito difícil você ficar sem taxi, mesmo na chuva!",5,1
Sensacional!!! Funciona perfeitamente e muito rapido!!!,5,1
Aplicativo sensacional! Recomendo.,5,1
Eu chamei o taxi e em menos de cinco minutos apareceu o motorista. Rapido e eficiente. Parabéns pelo serviço!!!,5,1
Esse app muda a vida (pra muito melhor) de quem anda de taxi em SP! Recomendo muito!,5,1
"O taxista pegou outra corrida após o meu chamado, tive que cancelar a corrida. O taxistas deveriam ser avaliados e bloqueados também por mal serviços e abusos pois é o que aconteceria em uma empresa de radio taxi.",1,0
Este App é demais. Tem muito taxista e funciona perfeito!! Indispensável para quem mora em SP,5,1
Não sei como eu vivi sem este aplicativo. E ótimo quando eu preciso pedir taxi pra trabalho e só posso pagar com credito. Obrigada!!!!!,5,1
"Muito bom. Ainda nao usei varias vezes, mas na primeira e unica experiencia ate agora tudo foi perfeito. Pretendo usar novamente.",5,1
Excelente forma de encontrar taxis em horarios dificeis.,5,1
Aprovado 100%,5,1
Uma coisa que deveria existir é a possibilidade de agendar corridas.,5,1
Falta permitir incluir o apto para o motorista poder chamar em situações especificas. Fazer pagto por aqui seria diferencial tbm.,5,1
"Rápido, àgil e taxista muito educado!!
Super indico !!!",4,1
Melhor aplicativo te taxi!,5,1
"Muito bom e eficiênte!
O taxicista chegou em menos de 5 minutos!!",5,1
Funciona mesmo....,5,1
Taxis sempre disponíveis com agilidade e bons veículos. Excelente!,5,1
Usei em sp zona Sul.  Muito bom.,5,1
"Rapido, Eficiente e Pratico demais!!!!!",5,1
Carro chega sempre em menos de 5 minutos. Incrível!!,5,1
"App muito bom. Necessita desenvolver opção de bandeira de CC. Taxista aceita cartão, mas somente de uma ou outra operadora. Incluir rankemento de motorista. Ha casos de confirmacao e abandono de passageiro.",5,1
Ótimo app,5,1
Nao tenho do que reclamar. Ja utilizei o serviço por umas 8 vezes e sempre funcionou corretamente. Ele poderia armazenar os endereços de onde chamamos os taxis.,5,1
excelente,5,1
Mt bom!!,5,1
"Perfeito, menos de 5 minutos cheou o táxi!!!",5,1
"Só falhou uma vez que o motorista, que estava no Butantã, deu sinal que ia me pegar em alto de Pinheiros e depois seguiu para o Morumbi, quase ponte João Dias. 
Falta versão pra Windows.",5,1
Muito prático e funciona!!,5,1
"Aplicativo muito bom, com taxistas super confiáveis!",5,1
É perfeito pra quem odeia telefone! E funciona mto bem!,5,1
Funciona muito bem!,5,1
App muito útil,5,1
"Excelente, muito rápido e preciso.",5,1
Rápido,5,1
Muito útil. Funciona que é uma beleza! O taxista é quem se perde as vezes..,5,1
Serviço de 1o mundo para um transito de 3o.,5,1
Uma boa ideia e util,5,1
Ótimo serviço!,5,1
"Nao ha criticas, apenas elogios. Excelente app, todos deveriam baixar.",5,1
"Funcionou perfeitamente, o GPS mostra o caminho do táxi, o nome do motorista, a placa e quantos minutos para o taxi chegar. Muito bom!",5,1
Nota 10,5,1
"App do tipo útil! O cadastro é simples, e funciona. Não tive problema com crashes. Espero que seja tão bom pros taxistas quanto é pra mim como passageira!",5,1
App Maravilhoso q resolve com segurança os problemas de locomoção de Sao Paulo,5,1
"Em meses de uso do 99 taxis na minha familia, so tivemos experiências excelentes. Muito util, pratico e eficiente. Recomendo a todos!",5,1
"Decretou o fim do radio taxi, pra mim.",5,1
"Deveria ser possivel avaliar na app:

O qto limpo é o carro

Aval de direção

Se fala muito

Qual o tipo ou modelo do carro",3,1
"Outros aplicativos me mandam monte coisa que dispenso. 99Taxi só me manda táxi, justamente o que estou procurando no app. Parabéns.",5,1
Muito bom!!,5,1
"Muito bom a corrida, em otimo tempo e finalmente taxistas bem humorados!!",5,1
O melhor app,5,1
Primeiro uso e funcionou perfeitamente! :),5,1
"Bom para o taxista, ótimo para o passageiro. Minha sugestão é poder dar um ""flag"" em motoristas imprudentes ou abusivos.",5,1
"Então por que minha classificação    baixa?
Por que ela so protege ao taxista e não da garantias aos passageiros.
Quando vc cancela uma viagem você deixa ""triste"" um taxista e vc pode ter so dois cancelamentos por dia. Acho perfeito para usuários não abusar do sistema.
Mas vc não tem um jeito de falar por que cancelou a viagem.
Acho fundamental os taxistas serem evaluados após a viagem. 
Por exemplo ontem minha viagem foi pega por um taxista que estava a 2 quadras  do meu endereço 5 minutos depois ele estava a 8 e continuava indo aumentando o tempo de espera! Ninguém se preocupo  que eu ficara ""triste"" com isso. 
Pelo resto acho um aplicativo otimo.",1,0
Tenho usado diariamente,5,1
Funcionou melhor que o agendamento pelo telefone! Recomendo!,5,1
Funciona,5,1

Chamei e não funcionou.,1,0
"Aplicativo sensacional, sem sombra de duvidas o melhor em Sao Paulo. Poderiam criar uma funcionalidade de pagamento da corrida via aplicativo.",5,1
"Facilita muito a vida de quem precisa pegar taxi. Mais seguro, mais rápido e um serviço muito melhor que o das companhias de taxi.",5,1
Excelente!,5,1
Vc consegue o taxi rapido e em qualquer lugar. O melhor é poder acompanhar onde ele esta e ainde se comunicar com ele. Seguro. Rapido. E nos dias de hoje o melhor... Pratico. Graças a deus ficamos livres da mafia dos ligue taxis da vida.,5,1
Nenhum furo até agora. É ótimo poder acompanhar pelo mapa a localização do carro. Motoristas conectados que sempre sabem chegar ao destino inicial e final!,5,1
"Muito bom e funciona perfeitamente
Pode usar que vai gostar!",5,1
Praticidade e segurança a qualquer hora do dia... 24h!,5,1
"Veio pra facilitar a nossa vida, sem contar na segurança.",5,1
Muito bom e funciona bem mas taxis disponíveis mesmo só em SP,4,1

"Funciona bem, mas deveria permitir escolher o taxi mais perto e/ou com menor tempo para chegar.",4,1
"Excelente App, rápido, pratico e funciona mesmo. Recomendo fortemente.",5,1
"Além disso, tenho sempre encontrado taxistas muito cordiais.",5,1
"Achei muito prático e útil. Me ajudou diversas vezes. Entretanto, ele deixa meu location services constantemente ativado, o que acredito levar a um gasto grande de bateria.",4,1
App perfeito! Unanimidade entre clientes e taxistas. Uso umas 3 a 5 vezes por semana. Nunca me deixou na mão.,5,1
Usei hoje pela primeira e achei ótimo!!! Rápido e eficiente,5,1

A única sugestão é que passasse a trabalhar com o mapa do Google Maps...",5,1
Futuro do taxi no mundo!!!,5,1
Prático e Seguro!,5,1
Adorei o app. Achei super simples e funcional !,5,1

"Estou contente com o serviço prestado. Boa qualdade e agilidade. 

Gostaria apenas que a UX do app fosse um pouco melhor. A ferramenta de localização do solicitante é um pouco falha. 

Deveria ter uma opçao para inserir diretamente o endereço com uma validação de margem de erro de 20 metros.

"voce so tem ideia do tempo que vai demorar para o taxi chegar depois que voce confirma o pedido. nao localiza direito onde voce esta, entao tem que inserir manualmente o endereço. a ideia do app é otima mas precisa melhorar muitas coisas pra ficar mais usavel.",1,0
tentei pedir taxi duas vezes hoje. a primeira o taxista nao sabia chegar e cancelou meu pedido. na segunda vez eu liguei para o taxista e ele disse que o programa fechou e ele perdeu meu chamado.... precisa ter um app que nao perde o chamado se fechar e taxistas mais responsaveis,1,0
